UTFT library modified to support HX8347-I
===================================================
This is the UTFT library from Henning Karlsen which was modified to support 2.8in 320x240 LCD display for Arduino MEGA 2560 from mcufriend.com.

This library was tested only with:
- this one display: 2.8in 320x240 LCD display for Arduino MEGA 2560 from mcufriend.com
- Arduino MEGA clone
- using setup parameters: UTFT myGLCD(HX8347I,38,39,40,41);

This project is based on the original UTFT library developed and maintained by Henning Karlsen.

This code is based on Henning Karlsen's work http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=51
